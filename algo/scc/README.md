Strongly Connected Components using Tarjan's Algorithm.

- Recursive version directly ported from UBC code archive.
    + Passes GeeksForGeeks test cases
    + Fails ACM online judge due to unknown runtime error
- Iterative version is derived from recursive version.
    + Passes GeeksForGeeks test cases
    + Passes ACM online judge involving SCCs
- Test both versions in GeeksForGeeks practice arena for accuracy

based on code using
<https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-490/2019W2/problem-solving/>

Run after compilation using

```
./k < tests/scc-1.in
```

and compare output with `tests/scc-1.out`.
